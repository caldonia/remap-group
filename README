Caldonia Remap Group
====================

Description
-----------

This plugin is designed to permit automatic remapping of group membership upon
a player logged into the server. It is only compatible with the
PermissionsBukkit plugin.

Impetus for Creating
--------------------

While setting up a server I hope to group I discovered that using
PermissionsBukkit it was only possible for users to be placed in the "default"
group upon first log in.

This meant that while things such as iChat could be made to say "Visitor"
instead of "default" there were many plugins which presented the "default"
label.

Plug In Abilities
-----------------

When a player logs in their group list is evaluated, should any of their group
memberships match a remap, then that group will be deleted and the replacement
added.

Additionally the plugin can be configured to send a announcement to the server,
and/or a message to the player.

Commands
--------
/crg list
List all current remaps loaded.

/crg reload
Reload configuration file.

Permissions
-----------
Permissions you can add to your admins/staff, alternatively op's have them.

caldonia.remap_group.list - Allows player to list all current remaps.
caldonia.remap_group.reload - Allows player to reload configuration file.

Caveat - DANGER! DANGER! Will Robinson
--------------------------------------
If you use it in the use case I designed it for you need to be aware that on
a popular server your Visitor group membership will grow large, quickly.

Regular deletion of the group membership is advised! This is one reason I
suspect PermissionsBukkit doesn't support this out of the box. Although
it could just permit you to specify which group is "default".

Installation
------------
1 - Copy CaldoniaRemapGroup.jar to your plugins directory.
2 - Restart/reload Bukkit.
3 - Edit configuration file plugins/CaldoniaRemapGroup/config.yml.
4 - Execute /crg reload in game or on the console.
